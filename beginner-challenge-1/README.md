## Relevance:
Diabetes is considered as one of the deadliest and chronic diseases which causes an increase in blood sugar. Many complications occur if diabetes remains untreated and unidentified. The tedious identifying process results in visiting of a patient to a diagnostic center and consulting doctor. But the rise in machine learning approaches solves this critical problem. The motive of this study is to design a model which can prognosticate the likelihood of diabetes in patients with maximum accuracy.

## Where should you start
This is a beginner challenge, if you are new to machine learning then strong your python skills and start learning fundamentals and basic methods of numpy, pandas and scikit-learn. And if you have some basics clear, just dive right into this challenge. Read starter material and code, learn from others work. If you feel stuck, feel free to ask us in the community.
