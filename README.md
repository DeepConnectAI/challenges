# DeepConnect Challenges

DeepConnect Challenges forms a series of *stepping stones* arranged across the ocean of data science and machine learning tools, techniques, algorithms, and applications. A step on the challenge will give you the knowledge, confidence, and skills to solve real world problems.

## Features of challenge series
- Challenges are curated by DeepConnect realizing the <b>impact</b> of group of challenges, <b>learning objectives</b>, unique content and skill level of participants.

- Difficulty of challenges <b>level up</b> from beginner to extreme as we progress through the series. Beginner challenges are generally common dataset available on popular machine learning websites whereas more advanced challenges will tackle rare and diffcult problems.

- There are challenges where DeepConnect provides <b>custom and curated dataset</b> to explore ideas and experience the fact that magic lines from libraries doesn't work unless you know fundamentals.

## Let's see the action
1. Each challenge has a well-defined problem statement, accessible dataset, timeline, evaluation metrics and optional starter code.
2. Throughout the challenge, DeepConnect shares more resources and enables the culture for discussions, code errors, and other questions.
3. Each challenge's end is marked by a powerful live session where top scorer's discuss their approaches and experience. Concepts, algorithms, and practices are also discussed in detail. These sessions always have something new to learn for everybody
